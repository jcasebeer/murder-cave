<h2>MURDER CAVE</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
</br>
You are a cop going lone wolf investigating a cave full of murderers... </br>
a murder cave!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
</br>
Players should have fun for 1 to 5 minutes </br>
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
platformer arcade game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

The player can move around and shoot their gun in any of the four cardinal directions.
</br> The player can use their gun to shoot the cave walls to make a path for themselves.
</br> The player's gun is also their primary tool to take out the murderers! use it wisely!</br>
The player can move onward to the next procedurally generated level by getting to the bottom of the screen </br>
The game has no sort of score system, the death rattle of each violent murderer should be
</br> enough satisfaction to anyone who plays this game.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong></br>
Randomly generated caves </br>
using an array to store level data </br>
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
randomly generated levels</br>
fully destructable levels! </br>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a cop investigating a cave which sources say is full of murderers. </br>
As you peer into the darkness you realize "Oh Gee, it's true!" </br>
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is targeted at people who like digging tunnels and dislike murderers.

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
forever until you die! When you do die you'll find yourself once again at the opening of </br> the cave... no this isn't groundhog day. I just was too tired to implement a proper
</br> game over screen.</br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
</br>
Shoot  a path across before shooting down to maximize the number of murderers </br>you can take out on each screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all of the assets except for the sound murderers make when they die. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
